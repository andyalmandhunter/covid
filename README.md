## Introduction
This repository contains code for visualizations of COVID-19 data in Maine. The visualizations of Maine COVID-19 data that are publicly available are very limited, so we (Berkeley and Andy Almand-Hunter) are working on a website to surface more visualizations to the public. We are not a part of any public health agency, and are just doing this for fun!

## Files
- covid_plots.py is the python code that creates the visualizations
- maine_covid_data.ipynb is not part of the production code, and is used a scratch pad
